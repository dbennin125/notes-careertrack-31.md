## Hooks API 
* useState() returns a pair:  current state value and functions that lets you update the state. 
* It's similar to this.setState but doesn't merge old state and new state together. 
* As with all state, you still need to initialize state. 
* React assumes useState is called in order during Render
* Hooks allow you to use React without classes. 
* useEffect can take the place of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount. 
* Only use Hooks at the top level, only from ReactReact function components. 
## List and keys
* Reading this article made me realize I've been doing this whole key thing wrong. This was very helpful. 
## Form
* The select tag seems very cool and I'm looking forward to creating a dropdown with it...although I'm pretty sure I've done this before and just forgot about it.
